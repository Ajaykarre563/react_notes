# react

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces (UI), especially for single-page applications (SPAs).

🔍 Key Features of React:
Component-based: UI is built using reusable components

Virtual DOM: Updates only the parts of the page that change, making it fast

Declarative: You describe what the UI should look like, and React handles the rest
